              "['Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament   Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Brussels, 8 July 2013 Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a great pleasure for me to be back with your committee for our last exchange of views before the summer break. At this time, it is worth taking stock of progress over the past 12 months. Clearly, financial conditions in the euro area today are more stable and resilient than they were last summer. This is partly due to our determined monetary policy actions. Governments and parliaments have also played a key role in the relative return of confidence and stability by undertaking courageous reforms, at both the national and European levels.  Yet despite this progress, the euro area still faces considerable challenges. The economy is still weak. Financial fragmentation remains. This challenges the very concept of the Single Market. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can find it difficult to access credit, particularly in countries under strain; and several key steps remain to be taken to complete the banking union. These are the three topics that I will address in turn today.  1. Economic and monetary developments  Let me first briefly discuss our recent monetary policy decisions. In May, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations by 25 basis points to 0.50% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 50 basis points to 1.00%. The rate on the deposit facility was left unchanged at 0%. These policy decisions took account of subdued underlying inflationary pressures over the medium term and they are expected to improve funding conditions across the whole monetary union.  Following its July meeting, the Governing Council stressed that the monetary policy stance is geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions.  It reiterated that its monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as needed. Furthermore, the Governing Council sharpened its communication by announcing that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation was based on the overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. The accommodative stance of our monetary policy, together with the significant improvements in financial markets since mid-2012, should help to support prospects for an economic recovery later in the year and in 2014.  On non-standard measures, the Governing Council decided in May to continue conducting all refinancing operations as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment, at least until mid-July 2014. This measure will help to support a smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy stance. In particular, it will ensure that banks’ lending decisions are not impaired by funding constraints. The Governing Council also decided in May to start consultations with other European institutions on initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralised by loans to non-financial corporations.  Before discussing this issue in more depth, let me briefly comment on the economic outlook. Economic activity in the euro area contracted for a sixth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of 2013. Labour market conditions remain weak. Recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement, albeit from low levels. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover over the course of the year, although at a subdued pace.  The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. The recent tightening of global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.  Annual inflation in the euro area has continued to moderate, falling from 2.5% in 2012 to 1.6% in June. Looking ahead, the underlying price pressures over the medium term are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Inflation expectations nonetheless continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to 2%.  Risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks relate to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices. Downside risks stem from weaker than expected economic activity. Consistent with our expectations of low underlying inflationary pressures over the medium term, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remains negative. To a large extent, weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the continuing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  2. Financial fragmentation and SME financing Let me now turn to the second topic namely the financing of SMEs. It is important to recall that the euro area financial system is mainly bank-based: around 80% of the debt of non-financial corporations consists of bank loans. There can be no sustained recovery without a sound banking system capable of effectively intermediating funds across the whole euro area.  Over the recent past, this intermediation process has suffered from two issues:  First, financial fragmentation, between peripheral and core countries; and  Second, higher challenges for SMEs relative to large firms.  On the first issue, lending rates are very heterogeneous across euro area economies. This reflects divergent bank funding conditions as well as country-specific macroeconomic developments that affect the creditworthiness of borrowers. The ECB took action, within our mandate, to alleviate this fragmentation: explicitly, we took action that alleviated funding constraints and reduced the dispersion of bank funding costs not least through the three-year long-term refinancing operations (LTROs). Still, the dispersion in lending rates across countries and borrowers remains substantial.  As regards the second issue, access to financing is more challenging for SMEs than for large firms. Spreads between bank lending rates for small-sized loans and large loans are still high by historical standards, although they have broadly declined since the last quarter of 2012. Difficult access to credit by SMEs is an issue for investment and growth in parts of the euro area, especially in countries under strain.  In Spain, for instance, the interest rate on small loans is almost 2.3 percentage points greater than interest rates on large loans. In France, by contrast, the difference is only 1 percentage point. Given their high dependence on bank credit, SMEs in countries under strain suffer particularly from financial fragmentation.  In this context, the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are looking into possible ways to support SME financing, notably in the form of joint risk-sharing instruments. These would combine the lending capacity of the EIB and the European Investment Fund as well as resources from national promotional banks to finance special activities in EU priority areas. A number of options – of both a short- and longer-term nature – are being explored, including the provision of guarantees, credit enhancements of SME loan pools to revive structured credit markets over a longer time horizon; and third, purchases of asset-backed securities (ABS) by the Commission and the EIB. Initiatives to foster the developments of the capital market, including the securitisation market, to complement the role of the banking system are particularly useful in the euro area.  With respect to securitisation, we have to be aware of the numerous constraints on the revival of ABS public issuance. These include in particular some proposed changes to the regulatory framework, which may reduce incentives to invest in certain types of ABS in the long term. Such constraints need to be properly addressed. The regulatory treatment for securitisation should acknowledge the credit performance and ensure an unbiased level playing field with other securities regarding risk, rating and maturity. I would also like to make clear that with regard to the ABS market the ECB now has an advisory role.  3. Banking union Policy-makers have made strong commitments on moving towards banking union – now it is essential to deliver on those commitments. The objective is effectively threefold: reinstating beyond doubt the soundness of the banking system; re-integrating the banking system; and delivering a supervisory and resolution framework that will prevent a repeat of the past risk build-up.  All core elements should fall into place swiftly to reap the full benefits of a banking union. The stakes are too high to afford undue delays. To complete such an essential project, resolute action has to be taken in the months to come – and this Parliament has a key role to play.  First, until the regulation on the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is adopted, we at the ECB cannot formally take decisions. In this context, it is my understanding that the supervisory accountability arrangements with the Parliament, in line with the SSM regulation, are nearing finalisation on the basis of a constructive stance by both parties.  In view of the adoption of the regulation, we have already launched the process of internal preparations, on which I would like to give you a brief update. We are working in close and constructive cooperation with the national authorities for the establishment of the SSM. This includes five main workstreams: first, mapping the euro area banking system to identify in particular systemic institutions; second, addressing legal issues in the development of the new supervisory processes at SSM level; third, preparing a harmonised supervisory data reporting framework; fourth, developing a supervisory model and manual; and fifth, designing and implementing the balance sheet assessment required by the SSM Regulation.  Let me be clear about the importance of that fifth workstream. A credible and thorough balance sheet assessment is an indispensable step towards restoring full confidence in the banking system. Transparency on asset valuation is necessary to subsequently assess the capital position of banks and also to facilitate market transactions on bank assets.  The balance sheet assessment will be complemented by a stress test, in coordination with the European Banking Authority, that will cover all banks supervised directly by the ECB. We expect to conclude the comprehensive assessment when the SSM becomes operational. It is crucial to have a commitment to ensure that effective backstops are available, in order to ensure that the assessment is duly and timely concluded.  A second cornerstone of banking union is the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). By providing the tools and powers in national laws, it will form a basis on which to build a single resolution mechanism (SRM). The ECB welcomes the fact that an agreement on BRRD was reached at the last ECOFIN meeting. I trust that this Parliament, together with the Council, will reach an agreement by the end of this year.  This will in turn pave the way for a swift entry into force of the European Stability Mechanism’s direct bank recapitalisation instrument. We welcome the political agreement reached at the last Eurogroup meeting. This instrument will usefully complement the existing European backstop and will contribute to the further decoupling of banks from their respective sovereigns.  A single resolution mechanism is the next crucial pillar of the banking union. It is an indispensable complement to the single supervisor and should ideally be in place once the SSM is operational. The ECB looks forward to the Commission’s proposal for an SRM with a strong single resolution authority at its heart and a single resolution fund at its disposal.  Thank you for your attention. I am now looking forward to your questions.',\n",
              " 'Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament   Introductory Statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the\\xa0ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 9 July 2018 Mr Chairman, Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be back at the European Parliament before your Committee. Since we last met, the ECB’s Governing Council has taken important decisions on the recalibration of our monetary policy stance after September this year. In my remarks today, I will outline these decisions and explain the assessment of the current economic environment on which they were based. Following the recent euro area summit, I will also take this opportunity to discuss the future of our Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), pointing to priorities for the near term from an ECB perspective. Economic and inflation developments The euro area economy grew by 0.4% during the first quarter of 2018, marking five years of continued economic expansion. Underlying economic fundamentals remain solid, notwithstanding some moderation in growth at the beginning of the year.  The labour market has improved notably over recent years. Employment has risen by 8.4 million since mid-2013, and is growing in nearly all euro area countries. The unemployment rate stood at 8.4% in May, its lowest level since December 2008, and labour force participation now stands at an all-time high.  Looking ahead, the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee average annual growth of 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. While uncertainties related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have become more prominent, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. Of course, we continue to closely monitor developments.  According to the Eurostat flash estimate, headline inflation increased to 2.0% in June from 1.9% in May, reflecting higher rates of energy and food inflation. Excluding these more volatile items, inflation decreased from 1.1% in May to 1.0% in June. As the economy continues to grow and slack is absorbed, supporting rising wages, underlying inflation is expected to pick up. Recent wage agreements in several countries point to a continuation of these favourable dynamics. I will discuss the inflation outlook in more detail as I explain the monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council in June. The ECB’s monetary policy and the phasing-out of non-standard measures  At our last monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council undertook a careful review of the progress made so far towards a sustained adjustment in inflation. Specifically, we assessed inflation developments against the three conditioning criteria for net asset purchases: convergence, confidence and resilience.  As regards convergence, the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections see headline inflation reaching 1.7% in each of the next three years. These are the latest in a series of projections which foresee inflation converging towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Our confidence in the inflation path is also rising. First, the range of uncertainty around the inflation projections has narrowed. Second, underlying inflation has increased from the very low levels that prevailed in 2016 and is foreseen to rise as the economy continues to expand, capacity utilisation strengthens and labour markets further tighten.  Finally, on the third criterion, the projected path of inflation appears to be self-sustained, i.e. resilient to a gradual ending of net asset purchases. On the basis of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that progress towards a sustained adjustment has been substantial so far and should continue in the period ahead, although some uncertainties persist. We therefore anticipate that after September we will reduce our monthly net asset purchases from €30 billion to €15 billion and will end our net asset purchases at the end of December. This is subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook. The expected end of the net asset purchases in December 2018 does not mean that our monetary policy ceases to be expansionary. Monetary policy will have to continue to accompany the economic expansion for some time. We have therefore reaffirmed our reinvestment policy and enhanced our forward guidance on the key interest rates.  We intend to maintain our policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. And we expect key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.  EMU governance: taking stock of financial union and the euro area architecture\\xa0 Let me now turn to the governance of Economic and Monetary Union. In times of heightened global uncertainty, it is more important than ever that Europe stands together. The efforts we have made in recent years to strengthen EMU governance have already made EMU more resilient to shocks. However, our monetary union is still incomplete and remains vulnerable. To support confidence and continue the economic expansion, we need further convergence and integration among euro area Member States.  It is almost exactly six years since European leaders decided to launch banking union. This was a major step forward and it has significantly contributed to risk reduction and thus a more stable European banking sector. But banking union is not yet complete. The swift adoption of the banking package will help to further strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. We welcome the Committee’s adoption of the report on the banking package and call for a swift trilogue process. The agreement on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as the backstop for the Single Resolution Fund is equally important. It will provide an additional layer of safety for banks in resolution, ensuring that they can be resolved effectively and without endangering financial stability. All this, in turn, will enhance confidence in the banking sector as a whole and make it more stable. The backstop should be made operational as soon as possible and be given swift and efficient decision-making procedures. In the period ahead, including the deliberations on a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS), we should not be held back by the distinction between risk reduction and risk sharing, for two reasons in particular.  First, substantial risk reduction has already taken place. Common Equity Tier 1 ratios of significant banks – a key indicator of bank health – are now 67% higher than they were ten years ago. Further risk reduction is under way with the reduction of non-performing loans and toxic assets in the portfolios of some large banks.  Second, risk-sharing greatly helps risk reduction. Consider the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It successfully resolved 500 banks without causing financial instability, also because it was backstopped by the US government. The corresponding number for the euro area was ten times lower, which is another reason why the euro area banking sector still faces structural challenges. In other words, if risk-sharing were to lead to an orderly management of the financial stability consequences derived from risk reduction, risk reduction would proceed at a much faster pace. Moreover, a European deposit insurance scheme would avoid the risk of destabilising self-fulfilling prophecies in the form of bank runs. It would also reduce the risk of financial fragmentation and thus support the effectiveness of monetary policy throughout EMU, contributing to economic stability. With the right policy framework, risk-sharing and risk reduction are thus mutually reinforcing[1].  A more resilient EMU would also benefit from a bolstered crisis management framework. The commitment to strengthen the ESM made at the recent Euro Summit is therefore very welcome. This should include an increase in its effectiveness and agility in terms of both governance and instruments, while fully respecting the mandates of the Commission and the ECB. To absorb shocks and reduce the risk of full-blown crises, the euro area would also benefit from a common stabilisation function. Such an instrument could provide macroeconomic support in the event of euro area-wide recessions, thereby preserving convergence, supporting stabilising national policies and allowing monetary policy to operate effectively. At the same time, this instrument should not undermine incentives for Member States to pursue sound fiscal and economic policies. We therefore very much welcome the renewed impulse to this discussion. An ambitious agenda for the capital markets union (CMU) can further underpin and facilitate the priorities I have outlined. First, CMU would increase private sector risk-sharing, and thus help to cushion local shocks, reducing the need for using public stabilisation tools. Second, a consistent framework is essential for deep and resilient financial integration. For instance, harmonising and improving insolvency frameworks would make it easier for banks to deal with non-performing assets, which would be beneficial to banks’ health. A genuine capital markets union would also support deeper, integrated and more stable capital markets, improving access to funding for all.  Let me emphasise that none of the measures I have mentioned are possible without trust between Member States, and that requires national governments to play their part in increasing the resilience of their economies and modernising economic structures.  Conclusion  Our monetary policy measures have been very effective. We estimate that the measures we have taken since mid-2014 will have an overall cumulative impact of around 1.9 percentage points on both euro area real GDP growth and inflation for the period between 2016 and 2020.  Our measures are playing a decisive role in bringing inflation back on track to reach a level that is below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. However, we need to be patient, persistent and prudent in our policy to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained adjustment path. As I have said before, downside risks to the outlook mainly relate to the threat of increased protectionism. A strong and united European Union can help reap the benefits of economic openness while protecting its citizens against unchecked globalisation. In leading by example, the EU can lend support to multilateralism and global trade, which have been cornerstones of growing economic prosperity over the past seven decades. But to be successful on the outside, the EU requires strong institutions and sound economic governance at home.  Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.

              " 'Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament    Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,Brussels, 16 December 2013  Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure for me to be back in your committee at such a decisive moment. The next days and weeks until the end of this legislature will show whether the euro area will be able to take another key step towards banking union. I believe your institution can play a crucial and constructive role in ensuring that this next step will entail a truly European dimension.  This is also the last time that I will discuss with you in detail matters related to the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Pending the appointment by the Council, Danièle Nouy will become the Chair of the Supervisory Board as of 1 January 2014. She will then also become your primary interlocutor with regard to the SSM. Today, I will first review recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area. I will then explain in greater detail our more recent monetary policy decisions and will present the progress in the preparations of the SSM.  Economic and monetary developments  Since our meeting in September, incoming information has confirmed the ECB’s assessment that underlying price pressures remain subdued over the medium term. The economic recovery in the euro area is fragile. Real GDP in the euro area expanded in the last two quarters: From July to September, it grew by 0.1% – quarter on quarter – following 0.3% in the second quarter of this year. Developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to November point toward a modest growth rate also in the last quarter of the year. At the same time, unemployment remains high. Necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors continue to weigh on economic activity. Looking further ahead, we expect output to continue to recover at a slow pace. This is in particular due to some improvement in domestic demand supported by our accommodative monetary policy. Euro area activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. Moreover, the improvement in financial market conditions and reduced uncertainty seems to be gradually transmitted to the real economy. Finally, the progress made in fiscal consolidation has strengthened the confidence of markets in the resilience of the euro area. This should also positively affect the recovery. Nevertheless, the risks to the outlook remain on the downside. They are mainly related to uncertain developments in global money and financial market conditions. Higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries could also negatively affect economic conditions. Annual HICP inflation increased in November to 0.9%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, following an unexpectedly strong decline in October to 0.7%. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. We might experience a prolonged period of low inflation to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. This reflects the modest pace of the recovery and the fact that medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be anchored in line with price stability.  Monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has stabilised at negative levels. Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets.  Recent monetary policy decisions  Based on this assessment of the current economic outlook, let me now explain in greater detail our more recent monetary policy decisions. In July this year, we introduced forward guidance to clarify the orientation of our monetary policy going forward in an exceptionally uncertain environment: we stated that we expected key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This statement was conditional on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, which is currently the case, as I have just explained.  In line with our forward guidance, we decided in November to lower the key ECB interest rates further. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations was lowered by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The rate on the deposit facility was left unchanged at 0.00%.  Our forward guidance still remains in place: we continue to expect ECB key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. Thus, monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary.  Adjusting interest rates is not always sufficient to maintain price stability. In this crisis, interest rate cuts have been transmitted more slowly and unevenly across euro area countries due to the fragmentation of financial markets. To address this problem, we adopted in recent years a series of non-standard measures. The purpose of these was – and remains – a more effective transmission of the ECB’s interest rate cuts, so that our monetary policy can reach companies and households throughout the euro area. This was also the purpose of our decision in November to continue conducting all our refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until July 2015. Thus, we have helped to alleviate funding concerns of banks, which are still hesitant to lend to households and firms.  Two years ago, we provided funding support to euro area banks through two Long Term Refinancing Operations with a maturity of three years each. As the funding situation of banks has improved significantly since then, banks have this year opted to repay about 40% of the initially outstanding amount. Accordingly, excess liquidity in overnight money markets has been gradually receding. We are monitoring the potential impact of these developments on our monetary policy stance. We are ready to consider all available instruments. As usual, it takes time before our policy decisions work their way through financial markets and affect the economy. The November decisions on interest rates, on forward guidance and on prolonging full allotment in all refinancing operations are working their way through.  Financial markets have taken up our conditional commitment to an accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period of time. Money market term interest rates and yields on bank bonds declined.  On the other hand, we are fully aware of the downward risks that a protracted period of low inflation entails. Consistent with its forward guidance, the Governing Council is ready and able to act if needed, as I mentioned at the most recent press conference . Furthermore, we currently see no signs of risks of financial imbalances related to the low interest rate environment. What we observe is still a very subdued trend in monetary and credit developments in the euro area.  Nevertheless, if we were to observe the build-up of such imbalances, this would be the field where macro-prudential authorities would have to intervene with market-specific instruments. Local risks have to be addressed by local instruments. This is why supervisory authorities, including the SSM, are now being equipped with the appropriate micro- and macro-prudential policy tools. I am confident that these will be used if necessary.  State of play of SSM preparations Let me now update you on the latest developments establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which are well underway.  Our internal preparations aim at ensuring that the ECB will be ready to assume its supervisory responsibilities in November 2014. We will make sure that the ECB’s monetary policy mandate focused on price stability will not be affected by considerations and decisions related to banking supervision. Internal rules are therefore being developed for the separation of monetary policy and supervisory functions: The units involved in decision-making will be clearly separated. We are putting in place an organisational set-up whereby the information flow between the two functions will be limited to a ‘need to know’ basis. However, we will avoid unnecessary duplication of structures not involved in the decision-making process. This is cost-efficient, and I am sure you will appreciate this.  As regards recruitment of staff, I can say that the process for senior and middle managerial positions is well underway. Further recruitment initiatives will start in due course.  An important element of our preparations is the comprehensive assessment, which comprises a supervisory risk assessment, an asset quality review and a stress test performed in cooperation with the European Banking Authority (EBA). This exercise will increase transparency by enhancing the quality of information available. It will facilitate the repair of the sector by identifying the necessary corrective actions. And it will build confidence by assuring all stakeholders that banks are fundamentally sound. It will be concluded shortly before the ECB assumes supervisory responsibilities.  The ECB convened a series of meetings in November in Frankfurt with the banks that will undergo the comprehensive assessment. These meetings were positively received and provided the useful opportunity to have a first exchange of views, to receive feedback on our communication, and respond to questions. We also explained that we would welcome prompt action from the banks, beginning now, to strengthen their balance sheets including profit retention and equity issuances.  Other elements of the comprehensive assessment are on-going. The process for the selection of asset portfolios to be reviewed for the asset quality review was initiated in November, based on specific data collections. Furthermore, we expect to announce the key parameters of the stress test exercise together with the European Banking Authority (EBA) towards the beginning of next year.  In this context, let me explain again the treatment of sovereign bonds: The Asset Quality Review is a valuation exercise where we will apply the current regulatory framework. It is not for us to change this framework – this is a global discussion, and the Basel Committee is the right forum for it. That said, we will of course “stress” a wide range of assets as part of the stress tests: Sovereign bonds will be among them. To ensure the credibility and rigour of the comprehensive assessment, backstops should be well specified and in place as soon as possible. The pecking order should be first private sources, then national public backstops and, as a last resort, European instruments.  Turning now from supervision to resolution, I understand you have reached agreement with the Council on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. Let me again strongly welcome this agreement, as it is an important step towards to the completion of the Banking Union.  However, for the credibility of the Banking Union, another step must be taken too: The SSM needs a strong and credible Single Resolution Mechanism as its counterpart. Responsibilities for supervision and resolution need to be aligned at the European level. Thus, I urge you and the Council to swiftly set-up a robust Single Resolution Mechanism, for which three elements are essential in practice: a single system, a single authority, and a single fund. We should not create a Single Resolution Mechanism that is single in name only. In this respect, I am concerned that decision-making may become overly complex and financing arrangements may not be adequate. I trust that the European Parliament, together with the Council, will succeed in creating a true Banking Union. Thank you for your attention. I am now looking forward to your questions.']"
